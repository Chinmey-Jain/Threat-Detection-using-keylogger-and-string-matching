# Threat Detection using Keylogger and String Matching

This Python project integrates core libraries such as `os`, `smtplib`, `pynput`, `email`, and `win32clipboard`. It functions as a sophisticated keylogger employing the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm for precise string matching. Operating on a 30-minute interval, it monitors keystrokes, promptly notifying the admin via email upon detecting suspicious words. The email transmission includes detailed system information and timestamps crucial for incident analysis. Efficient log file management ensures timely deletion when no matches occur, while threaded operations optimize performance for seamless security monitoring and proactive response strategies.

The project operates discreetly in the background, culminating in the reception of an email alert that notifies and flags the system for further action.
